***Introduction to object oriented programming***
Object oriented programming is considered as a standard way to program. It considers every real time object (living and non living) as a core living entity. for example me, my laptop, my bottle. these objects have attributes and behaviours which makes them unique.
these attributes can be stored with variables and we can write functions for these objects for manipulation and calculations. All these variables are different for every object in a class which makes every object unique. Everything in oop revolves around the object and translates real life problems in programming.
