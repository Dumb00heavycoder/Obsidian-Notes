**While loop**
"While this condition is not achieved continue doing this following output"
The above line sums up what while loop is all about. it executes a certain output again and again until the condition given is achieved

- syntax:- `while(condition) :`
		      `output`
		      `updation (optional)`
	
- problems:- 1)- [[Find factorial of a number]]
	2)- [[Find number of digits in a given number with for loop]]
	3)- [[reverse the digits in the given numbers]]
	4)- [[Palindrome number]]

**For loops**
_for_ loops are used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a **fixed number of times**. The for-loop is always used in combination with an [[Iterable objects]], like a list or a range 

- syntax: `for condtion:`
			`output`
			`updation(optional)`

- problems: 1)-[[Add first 10 integer]]
		2)- [[for loop for multiplication table]]
- 

- more on range and forloop:-  you can add a 3rd entry in your range, This third entry will ask the compiler to jump that amount of numbers.  Here's an example for this [[print only odd numbers from 1-11 range]]

**Formatted printing**
- End value:- every print statement has a end value which is /n by default. you can change it as per your needs in the print statement. syntax :- `end = " endstatement"`. 
	eg:- [[Change end value of a print statement]]

- Separator value:-  It is the value stored in the comma you use in print statements. you can change it with the following syntax:- `sep = "separator"` 
	eg:- [[Change separator value of dob]]
- formatted printing for printing string and int:- It is makes your life easy by allowing you to write integer and string in same print statement without much hustle. `syntax:- f"........"`. Integer values come in {} and string is written in the usual format.
	eg:- [[Printing int and string together (Formatted printing)]]
- you can also use format function and c style for format printing 


**Nesting**
Nesting in Python refers to the concept of placing one programming construct inside another. It is a very helpful technique in programming. It can be done in if-else, while loop and for loops. 
nesting can be done in the following ways:- 1)- for for 
2)- for while
3)- while for
4)- while while

**Break, continue & pass**
break = stops execution of loop
continue = skip the particular entry
pass = used to ask compiler to ignore a certain code block of else or something
