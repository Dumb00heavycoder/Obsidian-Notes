***List []***
In Python, a list is a built-in dynamic sized array (automatically grows and shrinks). We can store all types of items (including another list) in a list. A list may contain mixed type of items, this is possible because a list mainly stores references at contiguous locations and actual items maybe stored at different locations.

- List can contain duplicate items.
- List in Python are Mutable. Hence, we can modify, replace or delete the items.
- List are ordered. It maintain the order of elements based on how they are added.
- Accessing items in List can be done directly using their position (index), starting from 0.
- List can be used to create matrix
- You can do modifications as `L[len(L) - 1]` to access last item.

Understanding the workflow:-
a = [10, 20, "GfG", 40, True]

This sort of formation makes storing different types of data in one list possible. 

***Sets {}***
Sets in python are much like the sets you come across in Math
