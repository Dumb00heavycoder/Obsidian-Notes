Project(this is my own project i thought of while studying this week):- ask grok to make a csv file which will consist of planets, their moons, distance from sun, orbital period, rotation period, shape, mass, density, circumference, radius, surface gravity, escape velocity and surface temperature. Take all of this data and draw various important conclusions from it with pandas matplotlib and numpy. try giving these planets grades, apply interesting and different filters
