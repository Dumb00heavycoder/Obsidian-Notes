previous knowledge required :- [[Week 1]] [[Week 2]] [[Week 3]] [[Week 4]] [[Week 5]] [[Week 6 & 7]]
Week 6 has no theory so i'll be documenting my learning from the problems which are provided in week 1-6.

1)- type of expressions like `type(l.remove(5))` is always NoneType

2)- Set are mutable not not hashable in python. which means we can not store a set inside a set as set can only contain elements with [[Hashability property]]

3)- Set has no attribute like append

4)- python does not support + operator between set and integer. that means you can not add  a integer in a set with a plus sign
