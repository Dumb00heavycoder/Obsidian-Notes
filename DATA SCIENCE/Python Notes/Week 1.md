Week 1 contains alot of topics which i have already studied in c++ so i wont be specially documenting them as their syntax is also very easy to understand

- print statement
- input statement
- literals
- variables
- data types
- operators
- introduction to string 
- features of string:- 
	- in string you can do comparison between 2 strings. computer compares on the basis of which letters unicode is bigger. if the first characters are same it moves to the next characters. [[String comparisons]]
	- [[Slicing a string]]
- f ' ' helps you to embed variables directly inside a string in curly braces. Just like you use to do it in C. [[Format printing]]
