 1. Data Handling & Cleaning

	Skills: Handling missing values, outliers, inconsistent formats, duplicates.

	Tools: Python libraries like pandas, numpy.

	Why: Real-world data is messy. Cleaning ensures your models and insights are accurate.

 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

	Skills: Summary statistics, visualization, identifying patterns or anomalies.

	Tools: matplotlib, seaborn, pandas profiling.

	Why: Helps you understand relationships in data and guides further steps.

 3. Statistics & Probability

	Skills: Hypothesis testing, distributions, sampling, central limit theorem.

	Why: Data science is grounded in statistical reasoning. It helps interpret results confidently and build predictive models.

 4. Machine Learning

	Skills: Supervised learning (regression, classification), unsupervised learning (clustering), evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, ROC).

	Tools: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM.

	Why: Allows you to create predictive models from data.

 5. Programming

	Skills: Writing efficient code, debugging, automation, version control.

	Languages: Python is the most common; R and SQL are also useful.

	Why: Helps in data manipulation, modeling, and making your work reproducible.

 6. Data Visualization

	Skills: Choosing the right graph, storytelling with data, dashboard creation.

	Tools: matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, Power BI.

	Why: Communicates insights clearly to stakeholders or clients.

 7. Big Data Tools (optional but valuable)

	Tools: Spark, Hadoop, SQL, NoSQL.

	Why: Helps in handling large datasets that cannot fit into memory.

 8. Deep Learning (for advanced roles)

	Skills: Neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, transfer learning.

	Tools: TensorFlow, PyTorch.

	Why: Useful for image, text, or audio data problems.

 9. Business Understanding

	Skills: Domain knowledge, problem framing, aligning data science solutions with business goals.

	Why: Data science is useless if it doesn’t solve real-world problems effectively.

 10. Communication Skills

		Skills: Writing reports, explaining technical results in simple terms, creating presentations.

		Why: Data scientists must explain findings to non-technical audiences and influence decisions.

11. Ethics & Privacy

	Skills: Bias awareness, responsible data handling, fairness in AI models.

	Why: Ethical issues and data privacy are critical in today’s world.

 12. Experimentation & A/B Testing

		Skills: Designing controlled experiments, analyzing treatment effects.

		Why: Helps in making data-backed decisions, especially in product optimization.

13. Cloud & Deployment (for full-stack data science)

	Skills: Model deployment, APIs, scaling.

	Tools: AWS, GCP, Azure, Docker.

	Why: Allows your models to be used in production environments.
