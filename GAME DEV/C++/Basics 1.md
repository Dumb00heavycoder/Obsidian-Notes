Context:- Do not refer these notes if you are a beginner.  I already know c++ since June 2024 so this note session is just a revisit and a virtual documentation for me to refer in future.

Lets begin

C++ is a low level language created by Bjarne Storstrup. It works very close to the hardware and is great for memory management. Mostly used in competitive programming, video game development and lower end programming. 

***print program***
`#include <iostream>`
`using namespace std;`

`int main() {`
	`cout << "Hello world"<< endl;`
	`return 0;`
`}`

explanation:- 1)- our header line includes a stream of input output 
2)- namespaces are containers which contain functions. std namespace (standard namespace) is a namespace which contains the standard functions used in c++ like cout, vector, string etc.
3)- int main () is starting of our function. int tells our computer that this main function will return a integer value. This means that every time this main function will execute it will execute everything line by line and if it is done successfully it will reach the line return 0; which is a command that returns 0 to our computer to tell it that the program ran successfully. main is written to name our main function which executes the program. 
4)- cout is gonna print and endl simply means end line.  << is insertion operator which is used in inserting and >> is an extraction operator. 

***variables and comments***

- You can comment a line with // this is a comment 
- You can comment multi lines with `/*this is a comment` 
	`a multiline comment  */`

- variables are the same:- 
	int, float, string, char, double, boolean. 
	Name range is 1 to 225 char
	all name should start from letter or underscore
	after first alphabet a variable name can have numbers
	variables are case sensitive
	dont use reserved c++ words while making variable

- Because there is a function system in c++ so we also have local and global variables. They can have same names but the local variable is always preferred by the function over a global. 
- There are 3 types of data types in c++ 
	- 1)- Built in:- int, float, double,char and bool
	- 2)- user define:- struct, union, Enum
	- 3)- derived:- Array, function, Pointer
***Input***
Input syntax:- 
	`cin >> num 1;`
	`or` 
	`cout << "Enter a number ";`
	`cin >> num1;`

***Header files and operators***
system header files already exist but even users can create their own header files. 

***Operators***
Just like python we have 3 types of operators here also.
	1)- Arithmetic Operators:- +, -,  x, /, %, --a, a--, ++a and a++.
		a++, ++a, --a and --a are increment and decrement operators respectively. 
		a++ will first print/use the current value of a and after execution it will increment the value of a. ++a will first increase the value of a and then print it. same for the - one.
	2)- Comparison Operators:- `==, < , >, !=, <=, >=`
	3)- Logical operators:- && (and), || (or), !(not).
		example of ! operator:- 
				`cout << !(n1= n2) << endl;`

***Some more tips on variables***
Scope resolution operator can be used to change the scope of a variable. :: is the operator which will allow you to access the global variables. 
eg:- 
`#Include <iostream>`
`using namespace std;`
`int c = 10`
`int main () {`
`cout << ::c << endl;`
`return 0;`
`}`

every decimal in cpp is taken as a double to make it float write f after the number.
`d = 32.4f`

sizeof() function can be used in cpp


***Reference variables and typecasting***
- Reference variables:- giving different names to one data type.  
	 eg:- float x = 24.5;
		float & y = x;
- Type casting:- Changing a variables data type. 
		eg:- float b = 45.6
			cout << int(b); 

***Constant, manipulators and operator precedence***
- Operator precedence also exists in c++ just like it did in python and c.

- Constants:- constant variables are immutable variables. These can not be changed once created. eg:- `const int a = 3;`

- Manipulators:- manipulators are some inbuilt functions which improve the data display. Like endl and [[Setw (c++ manipulator)]]

***Control Structure***
Control structures are 3 types of structure which give a flow to our program. 

1)- Sequence structure:- A flow on commands in a sequence is simple sequence structure. 
eg:- print statements

2)-  Selection structure:- A flow of commands with choices is a selection structure. 
eg:- any if else program

3)- loop structure:- A flow of commands running in loops til a certain condition is satisfied are loop structures.
eg:- any program running with loops

***If else***
`syntax:-` 
`if (condition) {`

`}`
`else if (condition) {`

`}`
`else {`

`}`

***switch case***
switch case switches cases and gives output according to a case. 
eg:-
	`int main ()` 
	`int age;`
	`cout << "enter your age"<< endl;`
	`cin >> age;`
	`switch (age)`
		`case 18:`
			`cout << "You are allowed to the party";`
			`break;`
		`case 25:`
			`cout << "You are too old for the party";`
			`break;`
		`default:`
			`cout << "You are not invited to the party"; (wtf am i making)`
			`break;`
		
		

***Loops***

1)- For loops:- 
	syntax:- 
	`for(initialisation; condition; updation){`
		`body`
	`}`
	if the condition is always true then a infinite loop can be created
2)- While loop:-
	syntax:-
		`while (condition){`
			`body`
		`}`
3)- Do while loop:-
	`do {`
		`body`
	`} while(condition);`

***Break and continue***

it is what it is

***Pointers (headache)***
Pointers are data types holding addresses of another data type. 
eg:- 
`int a = 3;`
`int * b = &a;`
[[pointers example]]

***Arrays***
Collection of items of same type is known as an array. it is stored in contiguous memory locations. indexing is just done like python.

***Pointers and Arrays together***
You can create pointer of a array too. this pointer stores value of the 0th item in the array. you can access other values too by adding 1, 2, 3, 4, etc to the value of pointer. 

***Pointers Arithmetic***
In C++, pointer arithmetic means performing arithmetic operations on pointers. It refers to the operations that are valid to perform on pointers.Â 

1)- Increment and Decrement of a pointer:- Incrementing or decrementing a pointer will make it refer to the address of the next or previous data in the memory. This process differs from incrementing and decrementing numeric data. 

2)- Addition of a constant to a pointer:- We can add integer values to Pointers and the pointer is adjusted based on the size of the data type it points to. For example, if an integer pointer ptr stores the address 1000 and we add the value 5 to the pointer, it will calculate as :- 1000 + (5 * 4(size of an integer)) = 1020 

formula = ==address of a new pointer = address of the old pointer + (i * size of the datatype)==

3)- Subtraction can be done in the same way 

4)- Subtraction of two pointer of same data type:- The Subtraction of two pointers can be done only when both pointers are of the same data type. The subtraction of two pointers gives the number of elements present between the two memory addresses so it is primarily valid if the two pointers belong to the same array.
