1)- You can use to_string() or to_int to convert a data type

2)- concatenation of string is  possible in cpp too

3)- word.length() also exists in cpp

4)- cctype library in cpp allows you to use toupper and tolower functions which change the case of string. 

5)- you can use set library and create sets in cpp. 

6)- for loop can also be used to iterate through strings. eg:- for(char c : s). this will iterate through the s string character by character. helpful to read characters of string.
