1- Ipython shell is great here are some basic commands for intro:- 
		ipython = launch
		? = introduction of ipython and features 
		%quickref = quick reference
		help = help system
		object? = details about object

Ipython shell is great with documentation. If you wanna know about some inbuilt or userbuilt python function you can easily get it in ipython by using ?. Just place ? after the function and you'll get what it does.

You can use ?? to get source code of some functions. This will only work with functions which are written in python. functions like len which are written in c will just their function and no source code will be displayed.
