The client sends requests to the server as data. The server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client. 
**What is REST**
Rest stands for Representational State Transfer.It is a software architecture that imposes conditions on how an api should work. Rest defines a set of functions like GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. that clients use to access the server data. Clients and server exchange data using HTTP.
You can use REST-based architecture to support high-performing and reliable communication at scale. You can easily implement and modify it, bringing visibility and cross-platform portability to any API system.

**What Is Rest API**
API that uses REST architectural style are called REST APIs. 
The main feature in REST API is statelessness. Statelessness means that servers do not save client data between requests. client requests to the server are similar to urls you type in your web browser to visit a website. The response from the server is plain data without any typical graphical rendering of a web page.

**What are benefits of REST APIs**
1)- Integration:- APIs are used to integrate new applications with existing software systems. This increases the development speed because each functionality doesn't have to be written from scratch. 

2)- Innovation:- Business need to respond quickly and support the rapid deployment of innovative services. They can do this by making changes at the api level of their business instead of re-writing the whole code.

3)- Expansion:- API present a unique opportunity for business to meet their clients needs across different platform. Any business can give access to their internal data across platforms like android, ios,etc to expand their business and software. 

4)- Ease of maintenance:- Client and servers are obliged to make internal changes according to themselves so that api is not impacted. as it is only a gateway between these two systems. any future code by one party do not impact other
