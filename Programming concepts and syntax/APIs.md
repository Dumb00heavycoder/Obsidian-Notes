**What is an API?**
APIs are mechanism that enables two software components to communicate with each other on the basis of some set rules and protocols. For example google maps contain the map data of our planet and you are creating a app which is in need of real time map data of a certain location. Then you can make your application talk to google maps via APIs and show the real time map updates on your app accordingly. 
It is a like a bridge that allows flow of data from one component of an application to another.
API stands for application programming interface. Application here refers to software and interface refers to the contract of service between two application. this contract defines how the two communicate with each other using request and response. 


**How do APIs work?**
API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client and the application sending response is called server. 
In total there are 4 different ways that APIs can work depending on when and why they were created. 
These are:-  (this classification is according to the architecture)
	- [[SOAP APIs]]
	- [[RPC APIs]]
	- [[Websockets APIs]]
	- [[REST APIs]]

**What are API integrations?**
API integrations are software components that automatically update data between client and server. for example when the time and date of your laptop and mobile changes according to the timezone you are in. 

**Types of API according to scope**
Private APIs
These are internal to an enterprise and only used for connecting systems and data within the business.

Public APIs 
These are open to the public and may be used by anyone. There may or not be some authorisation and cost associated with these types of APIs.

Partner APIs 
These are only accessible by authorised external developers to aid business-to-business partnerships.

Composite APIs 
These combine two or more different APIs to address complex system requirements or behaviours.

**What is an API endpoint why is it important**
API endpoints are the final touch points in the API communication system. These include server URLs, services, and other specific digital locations from where information is sent and received between systems. API endpoints are critical to enterprises for two main reasons which are security and performance. API endpoints make the system vulnerable to attack, api monitoring is crucial for preventing misuse. API endpoints especially high traffic ones can cause bottlenecks and affect system performance. 

**How to use an API**
1. Obtaining an API key. This is done by creating a verified account with the API provider.
2. Set up an HTTP API client. This tool allows you to structure API requests easily using the API keys received.
3. If you don’t have an API client, you can try to structure the request yourself in your browser by referring to the API documentation.
4. Once you are comfortable with the new API syntax, you can start using it in your code.

**Where to find API?**
You can find them on API marketplaces and API directories like Rapid API, Public API and APIForThat and APIList

**What is an API gateway**
An API Gateway is an API management tool for enterprise clients that use a broad range of back-end services. API gateways typically handle common tasks like user authentication, statistics, and rate management that are applicable across all API calls.
You can use Amazon API gateway.
