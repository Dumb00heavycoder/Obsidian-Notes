**What is an API?**
APIs are mechanism that enables two software components to communicate with each other on the basis of some set rules and protocols. For example google maps contain the map data of our planet and you are creating a app which is in need of real time map data of a certain location. Then you can make your application talk to google maps via APIs and show the real time map updates on your app accordingly. 
It is a like a bridge that allows flow of data from one component of an application to another.
API stands for application programming interface. Application here refers to software and interface refers to the contract of service between two application. this contract defines how the two communicate with each other using request and response. 


**How do APIs work?**
API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client and the application sending response is called server. 
In total there are 4 different ways that APIs can work depending on when and why they were created. 
These are:- 
	- [[SOAP APIs]]
	- [[RPC APIs]]
	- [[Websockets APIs]]
	- [[REST APIs]]
