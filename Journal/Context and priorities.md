typing is something i always prefer more than writing so why not journal here too.
Context:- I have been working on a lot of things lately which has increased the work load by a large amount and honestly managing this work isn't that easy. 
so keeping a journal is how i'll take it.

First let me go through my thoughts on what all i have and how i wish to execute it. 
My very first priority is staying up to date with my IITM studies which are not going so well currently thanks to my procrastination. My 2nd priority is learning the skills i need for data science and game development. My 3rd priority is to clear jlpt and learn Japanese so i can have a good chance at my dream companies. My 4th priority is my health and family which is manageable. 

IITM studies will be taking most of my time for next 4 years and i guess i should give them most of my time too. Next i wish to Focus on my skill development in data science and game development sector. I know people will ask me why both why not one and my simple answer to that is why not. Gaming is risky but it is something very close to me. Data science is good but can get exhausting in a long run. i really don't know wtf is gonna work for me in future so lets just keep rolling with the cards i have rn.

everyday 1 hour to Japanese is very much enough for clearing n5 by December and  n3 by 2028. For constant problem solving skill development everyday 1 codeforces question is also something i will try to keep a track of. 

I have 3 semesters every year and between these sems i get a break of 10-15 days where i will increase my time of skill and Japanese alot. Making good schedules is something I've never been good at so its a problem we'll tackle along the road. For my fitness i have a callisthenics plan which i alter every 4-5 month and I try to spend most of my free time with family, girlfriend and all. Plus i am doing an online degree which also allows me to visit people.
