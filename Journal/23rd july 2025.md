1)- I have been taking a break from classes. this break was from 19july to 23rd july and damn i feel lazy after it. We'll start back with our classes from 24th july as we have our quiz 2 on 3rd august. I only have to attend stats and math as my python will be taken in oppe format later on. My main priority and goal right now is to focus very hard on these 3 subjects to increase my cgpa.  I also need to focus on development of my study habit, I've completely lost it since i started my college. My main focus is to get 4 hours on 24 and up them to 8 before quiz 2. Then i'll try to maintain the hours between 5-8 range. 

2)- I'll only spend few hours on sunday with my game. These will be just brain storming idea scorching sessions.

3)- My health is going good and i am keeping up with my callisthenics pretty clean.

4)- managing japanese and sitting for meditation is something i am still not able to do properly. will need to add that soon once i build my callisthenics and study habit. 

5)- my friend has started working on a project so i must assist him on that too.
