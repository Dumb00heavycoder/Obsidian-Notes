25 i was busy with family which took alot of time out of my day.
26 also i was busy with my family which also took almost all of the time but i did manage to do some code forces with some cpp. 
i have my exam on 03 aug which means i wont be following my schedule for a day or two and instead i'll only focus on math and stats non stop. 
i'll keep my journaling and problem solving going. 

callisthenics is on a bit of a lack too because of my constant tired body. Bad eating habits tbh. 
japanese is on a hold too thanks to my quiz2. 
I believe till quiz 2 we are completely booked.
