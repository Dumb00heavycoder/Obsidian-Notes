Got some classes done of stats. My sleep schedule sucks and i sleep alot which is the main reason i am not able to take morning classes. Need to fix that by 26 otherwise i am cooked

Had a good callisthenics session, got some good stretches and alot of protein down my stomach. Tested some skills today but i am really shaky. more of it everyday will probably take me to the end.

Did alot of japanese listening and reading casually in night.

at the end i gave myself a good break. I surely didnt follow my schedule even 80% up but its a progress.
